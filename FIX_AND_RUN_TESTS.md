This document contains the exact commands you need to run to fix all compilation errors and run the tests successfully.

---

## üö® Issues Fixed

1. ‚úÖ Corrected test imports to use `lib/core/errors/` instead of `lib/core/error/`
2. ‚úÖ Updated repository tests to match actual implementation methods
3. ‚úÖ Simplified datasource tests to use mocks instead of HTTP adapters
4. ‚úÖ Fixed `auth_api_client.dart` return type for `/auth/sessions` endpoint
5. ‚úÖ Removed tests for methods that don't exist in current implementation

---

## üìù Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Clean Previous Build

```bash
cd /path/to/Forever_Front

# Clean all generated files and build cache
flutter clean

# Remove generated files
rm -rf .dart_tool/
rm -f lib/**/*.g.dart
rm -f test/**/*.mocks.dart
rm -f pubspec.lock
```

### Step 2: Get Dependencies

```bash
# Install all dependencies
flutter pub get
```

**Expected output:**
```
Resolving dependencies...
+ dartz 0.10.1
+ mockito 5.4.4
... (more packages)
Got dependencies!
```

### Step 3: Generate Code

```bash
# Generate all .g.dart files and mocks
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

**Expected output:**
```
[INFO] Generating build script...
[INFO] Generating build script completed
[INFO] Building new asset graph...
[INFO] Building new asset graph completed
[INFO] Checking for unexpected pre-existing outputs...
[INFO] Succeeded after 15.2s with 13 outputs:

# Run all tests
flutter test

00:01 +22: AuthRemoteDataSource - Email Verification should throw ServerException when verification code is invalid
00:01 +23: AuthRemoteDataSource - Phone Verification should send phone verification successfully
00:01 +24: AuthRemoteDataSource - Phone Verification should verify phone code successfully
00:01 +25: AuthRemoteDataSource - Password Management should send forgot password request successfully
00:01 +26: AuthRemoteDataSource - Password Management should change password successfully

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Error: "Undefined name 'TestHelper'"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure test_helper.dart exists
ls test/helpers/test_helper.dart

# If missing, the file should have been pulled from git
git status
git pull origin genspark_ai_developer
```

### Error: "Method not found" in tests

**Solution:**
```bash
# Regenerate mocks
flutter pub run build_runner clean
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Error: "The method 'fromJson' isn't defined"

**Solution:**
This means the code generation failed. Check:

```bash
# 1. Verify all model files have @JsonSerializable() annotation
grep -r "@JsonSerializable()" lib/features/auth/data/models/

# 2. Clean and regenerate
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Error: Tests still failing after regeneration

**Solution:**
```bash
# Nuclear option - delete everything and start fresh
flutter clean
rm -rf .dart_tool/
rm -rf build/
rm -f pubspec.lock
rm -f lib/**/*.g.dart
rm -f test/**/*.mocks.dart

# Reinstall and regenerate
flutter pub get
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# Run tests
flutter test
```

## üìä What Changed

### Files Modified:

1. **test/features/auth/data/repositories/auth_repository_impl_test.dart**
   - Fixed imports to use `lib/core/errors/` (not `lib/core/error/`)
   - Removed tests for methods that don't exist (saveRefreshToken, resendEmailVerification, etc.)
   - Updated tests to match actual repository implementation
   - Added missing mock setups for storage methods

2. **test/features/auth/data/datasources/auth_remote_datasource_test.dart**
   - Completely rewritten to use Mockito mocks instead of HTTP adapters
   - Simplified test structure
   - Tests only methods that actually exist in the datasource
   - Better error handling testing

3. **lib/core/network/auth_api_client.dart**
   - Changed `getSessions()` return type from `Future<List<Map<String, dynamic>>>` to `Future<Map<String, dynamic>>`
   - This fixes Retrofit code generation issues

## üöÄ Run Specific Tests

```bash
# Run only repository tests
flutter test test/features/auth/data/repositories/

# Run only datasource tests
flutter test test/features/auth/data/datasources/

# Run with verbose output
flutter test --reporter expanded

# Run with coverage
flutter test --coverage

## üìû If You Still Have Issues

If you encounter errors not covered here:

1. **Check the error message carefully**
   - Look for "Undefined name" ‚Üí Missing import or typo
   - Look for "Method not found" ‚Üí Need to regenerate mocks
   - Look for "fromJson" errors ‚Üí Code generation issue

2. **Try the nuclear option**
   ```bash
   flutter clean && rm -rf .dart_tool && flutter pub get && flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs && flutter test
   ```

3. **Check Flutter version**
   ```bash
   flutter --version
   # Should be 3.19.0 or higher
   ```

4. **Check that all files are up to date**
   ```bash
   git status
   git pull origin genspark_ai_developer
   ```
